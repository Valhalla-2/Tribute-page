                    Tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, a period during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience which influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, Mikhail Romm, allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.</p> 
                    <p> Tarkovsky was, according to Shavkat Abdusalmov, a fellow student at the film school, fascinated by Japanese films. He was
                        <p>In 1972, Tarkovsky told film historian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kozlov" title="Leonid Kozlov" rel="nofollow">Leonid Kozlov</a> his ten favorite films. The list includes: <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Country_Priest" title="Diary of a Country Priest" rel="nofollow">Diary of a Country Priest</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouchette" title="Mouchette" rel="nofollow">Mouchette</a></i>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bresson" title="Robert Bresson" rel="nofollow">Robert Bresson</a>; <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Light" title="Winter Light" rel="nofollow">Winter Light</a></i>, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Strawberries_%28film%29" title="Wild Strawberries (film)" rel="nofollow">Wild Strawberries</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28film%29" title="Persona (film)" rel="nofollow">Persona</a></i>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman" rel="nofollow">Ingmar Bergman</a>; <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar%C3%ADn" title="Nazarín" rel="nofollow">Nazarín</a></i>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Bu%C3%B1uel" title="Luis Buñuel" rel="nofollow">Luis Buñuel</a>; <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Lights" title="City Lights" rel="nofollow">City Lights</a></i>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin" rel="nofollow">Charlie Chaplin</a>; <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugetsu" title="Ugetsu" rel="nofollow">Ugetsu</a></i>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenji_Mizoguchi" title="Kenji Mizoguchi" rel="nofollow">Kenji Mizoguchi</a>; <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Samurai" title="Seven Samurai" rel="nofollow">Seven Samurai</a></i>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa" title="Akira Kurosawa" rel="nofollow">Akira Kurosawa</a>, and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_in_the_Dunes" title="Woman in the Dunes" rel="nofollow">Woman in the Dunes</a></i>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Teshigahara" title="Hiroshi Teshigahara" rel="nofollow">Hiroshi Teshigahara</a>. Among his favorite directors were Buñuel, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Antonioni" title="Michelangelo Antonioni" rel="nofollow">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Vigo" title="Jean Vigo" rel="nofollow">Jean Vigo</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Theodor_Dreyer" title="Carl Theodor Dreyer" rel="nofollow">Carl Theodor Dreyer</a>.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky#cite_note-19" rel="nofollow"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
                        <p>With the exception of <i>City Lights</i>, the list does not contain 
                            any films of the early silent era. The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film
                             as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early 
                            film-making forming only a prelude. The list has also no films or 
                            directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet 
                            directors such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Barnet" title="Boris Barnet" rel="nofollow">Boris Barnet</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Paradjanov" title="Sergei Paradjanov" rel="nofollow">Sergei Paradjanov</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dovzhenko" title="Alexander Dovzhenko" rel="nofollow">Alexander Dovzhenko</a> highly.</p>
                            <p>Although strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator" title="The Terminator" rel="nofollow">The Terminator</a></i>,
                                saying its "vision of the future and the relation between man and its 
                               destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art". He was critical of
                                the "brutality and low acting skills", but nevertheless impressed by 
                               this film.</p>

                        <p>Tarkovsky's films are characterised by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics" rel="nofollow">metaphysical</a> themes, extremely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_take" title="Long take" rel="nofollow">long takes</a>,
                            and memorable images of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are 
                           dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain 
                           indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the 
                           foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said, 
                           “Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating 
                           him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far 
                           away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of 
                           cinema.”</p>
                           <p>Tarkovsky included levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably <i>Solaris</i>. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability<sup>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky#cite_note-20" rel="nofollow"></a></sup></p>
                           <p>Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for its surreal 
                            beauty and photogenic value, as well as its symbolism, such as waves or 
                            the form of brooks or running water.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky#cite_note-21" rel="nofollow"></a></sup></p>
                            <p>Bells and candles are also frequent symbols. These are symbols of 
                                film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of 
                                self reflection.</p>
                                <p>Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called "sculpting in 
                                    time". By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a 
                                    medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie 
                                    footage transcribes time in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_%28media%29" title="Real-time (media)" rel="nofollow">real time</a>.
                                     By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the 
                                    viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one 
                                    moment in time to another.</p>
                                    <p>Up to, and including, his film <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mirror_%281975_film%29" title="The Mirror (1975 film)" rel="nofollow">The Mirror</a></i>, Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After <i>The Mirror</i>, he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_unities" title="Dramatic unities" rel="nofollow">dramatic unities</a> proposed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle" rel="nofollow">Aristotle</a>: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.</p>
                                    <p>Several of Tarkovsky's films have color or black and white sequences, including for example <a
